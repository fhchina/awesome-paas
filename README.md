## Quick Starts

### OpenShift and OKD
  
* [Getting started with Minishift](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html): A documentation 
  about how to prepare a virtualization environment on macOS, Linux or Windows, set up Minishift, and start using it. 
  Minishift is a tool that helps you run OKD locally by launching a single-node OKD cluster inside a virtual machine. 
  With Minishift you can try out OKD or develop with it, day-to-day, on your local machine.

* [Installing OKD 3.10 on a Single Host](https://blog.openshift.com/installing-okd-3-10-on-a-single-host/): A 
  video that shows how to install OKD from start to finish using the Ansible playbooks that are provided as the
  official way to install a cluster. This is more involved than using the OKD Docker image or Minishift but better
  suited to a system that is meant to be always running. Works with OKD 3.11, too.
  
* [Adding an SSL certificate to OKD](https://youtu.be/S7HoJ09oYn0): A companion video to 
  'Installing OKD 3.10 on a single host' to add a Let's encrypt certificate to the console.
  
* [Free Wildcard Certificates and OpenShift](https://blog.openshift.com/lets-encrypt-acme-v2-api/): A blog post 
  explaining how to add a Let's encrypt wildcard certificate to an existing OKD or OpenShift installation for 
  both the console and the deployed apps.

* [OKD Getting started as a developer: Web console walkthrough](https://docs.okd.io/latest/getting_started/developers_console.html):
  This getting started experience walks you through the simplest way to get a sample project up and running on OKD
  using the web console. 

* [OKD Getting started as a developer: Command-line walkthrough](https://docs.okd.io/latest/getting_started/developers_cli.html):
  This getting started experience walks you through the simplest way to get a sample project up and running on OKD
  using the command-line.

* [Reza Shafii: Kubernetes guideposts for 2019. OpenShift Blog, Jan 2019](https://blog.openshift.com/kubernetes-guideposts-for-2019/)
  Reza predicts automated operations will be the next step, federation V2 will make multi-cloud easier, serverless comes
  to Kubernetes and 2019 will be the year of hybrid serverless, k8s will enable hybrid operations for containers and
  virtual machines and it'll be on bare metal, open source developer communities target k8s by default, we will see
  workloads start moving back to the datacenter.

* [Dan Meyer: Cloud Foundry Adopts a Pair of Kubernetes-Based Projects. SDXCentral, Oct. 2018,](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/cloud-foundry-adopts-a-pair-of-kubernetes-based-projects/2018/10/):
  Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR), which allows for deploying containers using Bosh and Kubernetes.
  Eirini, which allows operators and vendors to use Kubernetes as the underlying container scheduler for the Cloud 
  Foundry Application Runtime. CF Containerization, which packages Bosh into containers that are deployed into 
  Kubernetes. This allows operators to deploy the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime into existing clusters.
  CFCR was the beachhead for Cloud Foundry into the Kubernetes ecosystem. Eirini and CF Containerization build on 
  that approach.
